It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal 'til the victory is won
No colour or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun
Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away
It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag, no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun
